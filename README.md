# Vibe-hud
This is my hud that i am going to be working on, which is going to be an edit of mr slin's Slin Fire hud https://github.com/misterslin/SlinFireHUD , huge shoutout to AurahTF, Steve "MR SLIN" Lin, and Raysfire for making the hud that i am using as a base. This hud is going to be mainly a competitive hud and trying to be minimalist.
